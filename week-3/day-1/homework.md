# Writing/Blogging & Koans

## Explorer Mode Part One

- If you don't have a blog, start one. Good site for starting one: [Medium](medium.com)
- Watch these videos:
  - ["Taste" ](https://vimeo.com/85040589)
  - ["Asking Questions"](https://vimeo.com/85040589)
- Write a blog to cover these topics:
  - Reflect and comment on Ira's comments about the need for practice and the sense that you feel like your work isn't quality yet. This is a hard aspect of becoming a developer and something you'll face for a while.
  - Has your views on fixed-versus-growth mindset changed since starting TIY cohort, if so how?
  - How has the process of asking questions gone for you? What have you learned about your own process of asking for help and learning?
  - Have you had any "aha!" moments yet? If so, what are they? If not, thats ok, share what challenges you've faced and how you are forging ahead.
- Your blog post should be a few paragraphs at least. Here is a good example (though not something to copy, but emulate). [Amanda Porto](https://medium.com/@dinhaoporto/the-ineffable-joy-32b30d9dfaa#.vrabqcxyn)

## Explorer Mode Part Two

The Ruby Koans are a set of practices that can be repeated to reinforce core programming and `Ruby` skills.

We are going to walk through portions of the Koans tonight to practice the Ruby areas we have learned so far.

## Preparation

- Visit [this url](https://github.com/tiy-tpa-ruby/koans) and click on the `fork` button in the upper right corner.
- This will make a new repository in your _own_ account named `koans`
- Click on the `Clone or Download` button
- Make sure `Clone with SSH` is shown
- Copy that URL
- Open your terminal
- `cd` to the directory where you would normally type `take` and a new homework name. *DO NOT RUN TAKE* for this assignment.
- _Instead_ enter: git clone URL
- *WHERE URL IS THE URL YOU COPIED EARLIER*
- Example: `git clone git@github.com:NAME/koans.git`
- `cd koans`

## Running each practice

- Working through the core set of Ruby Koans!
- To run an individual practice: `ruby filename.rb`
- Each practice will require you to fill in bits of code where you see `__` in various methods. Read through the instructions in each file.
- *NOTE:* After finishing each koan file below, make sure you are doing `git add`, `git commit` and `git push`
- Finish the koans in each of these:
  - about_strings.rb
  - about_symbols.rb
  - about_objects.rb
  - about_variable_scope.rb
  - about_nil.rb
  - about_array.rb
  - about_array_assignment.rb
  - about_hashes.rb
  - about_iteration.rb
  - about_methods.rb
  - about_classes.rb

## Adventure Mode

- Pick a few interesting koan files not covered above and complete them.

## Epic Mode

- Finish all the koans and reach enlightenment!
